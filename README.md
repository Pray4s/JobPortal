The platform allows users to create and manage profiles, browse job listings, and apply for positions. Employers can post job openings, view applications, and manage candidate profiles. The system incorporates user authentication using JWT, dynamic job listings, and responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. Features like job filtering, user profile management, and secure login contribute to an efficient and user-friendly job-searching experience.
